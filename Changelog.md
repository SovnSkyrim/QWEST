Removed:
- Alternate Start - Live Another Life 
    - Wanted something fresh, Skyrim Unbound provides more choices and doesn't force you to go through the Main Quest as much, may be quite refreshing. Lastly I dislike the Guildmaster Start or the Solitude Docks start so those are gone as well. (also I like less Arthmoor)
- Armor Variants Expansion
    - Residue of old QWEST! versions, not incredible and caused some NPCs to be naked.
- Inigo
    - A majority of people like him. I personally don't. On top of that, users reported non-issues from other Wabbajack lists to his Nexus page which led them to make a public pinned post about their [non favorable stance with what we do](http://prntscr.com/1b2tt18) so I am not going to use him any further in QWEST!. This decision is final. A tutorial on how to restore him back has been added to #list-modifications [in my own Discord](https://discord.gg/ZgjVrXp).
- Ride Sharing
    - Sometimes work, sometimes doesn't, unsure why. Couldn't reliably make it work so it's gone.
- Nether's Follower Framework
    - A new follower setup has been added due to this mod not being hosted on Nexus anymore but partly on Schaken which is known to host pedophilic content so I do not wish my work to be associated with such disgusting practices.

- Regenerated xLODGEN Terrain/DynDOLOD/Occlusion/Bodyslide
