# Preamble

QWEST! was born after a few friends were talking about how some of their friends couldn't enjoy cool quests in modded Skyrim, even with Wabbajack, due to the hardware requirements. This list has very few graphical enhancements which can be removed if you find you're struggling to run it.

I chose mods that overhaul almost all of the vanilla quests, added some major mods such as Legacy of the Dragonborn, Interesting NPC's, Wyrmstooth and the Forgotten city, and also overhauled the animations a bit. You'll also find new music, new armors and weapons that are linked to LotD and vanilla enhancing weathers and lighting. You even have the choice between EnaiRim and SimonRim with the 2 available Profiles!

If you can run vanilla Skyrim, you should be able to run this.

If you have any questions regarding the list, you're free to ask in the main Wabbajack Discord or mine :[here](https://discord.gg/ZgjVrXp)

It is a fork of the amazing SME/FT list; if you want to build your own list check it out [here](https://github.com/EzioTheDeadPoet/SME-FT-)!

The name and picture are a reference to the amazing and wholesome Quest Sprout comic available on [swordscomic.com](https://swordscomic.com). Their official Twitter is [here](https://twitter.com/swordscomic).

# READING THIS README IN ITS ENTIRITY IS REQUIRED FOR THE LIST TO WORK, IT WILL NOT WORK IF YOU DON'T READ. THIS ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE SO BE PATIENT AND READ CAREFULLY. THE README DOESN'T END AT "HOW TO START UP THE LIST". I am going to answer "readme" to any question answered in this document, you have been warned.

# Noteworthy Mods and what gameplay to expect.

Depending on the choice of profile, you will have a very different approach to the list. [EnaiRim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191) will make you and your enemies stronger overall while [SimonRim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746) will remain simple and closer to Vanilla.
If you're unfamiliar with those overhauls, you should read their modpages as the changes are at the base of everything.

## Survival
If you chose to not make any modifications and go with the survival mods, you will have way more micromanagement to do.

1. You will need to eat and sleep to survive. 
2. You will need to survive the cold or your stamina will drain and you'll die. 
3. You will need to clean yourself or you'll have very bad prices and everyone will smell you when trying to sneak.

You should definitely check the Skill Trees within your campfire on top of the vanilla skill trees, your arrows will have a weight and you will need to sleep to level up your Character level. If you're unfamiliar with the survival mods, have a read of [Campfire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667), [Dirt and Blood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40746), [Keep it Clean](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17846) and [SunHelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414).

Fast travel is disabled in multiple of these mods so there's no easy way to reactivate it at all times but there's an alternative: [Horizon Zero Dawn Fast Travel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35793).

Lastly, all profiles have way better horse management thanks to [Convenient Horses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9519), you can even let one of your followers mount behind you thanks to [Ride Sharing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11734)!

## Added Quests

[Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30980) forms the core spine of the list. QWEST! is the list with most addons for the it, but many new lands aren't integrated with the musuem. These include [Unslaad](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11789), [Darkend](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10423) and [Undeath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6180/?), all of which you can find in QWEST!

[Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194), [Skyrim Sewers 4](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9320) and [VIGILANT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849) are in and provide artifacts aswell as many new stuff to do. As well as those, you can find The [Tools of Kagrenac](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14168), [G.R.I.M](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41816), [The Forgotten City](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1179), [Wyrmstooth](https://tes-mods.fandom.com/wiki/Wyrmstooth), [Helgen Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5673) or [Beyond Reach](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3008). A much more detailled Spreadsheet on the variety of quests in the list can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15h4lGfMr4z_1hqPp8LDVbTLLRqgjaQBUUSIYc6XtJGU/edit#gid=0).

## Overhauled Quests
From [Finding Derkeethus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19550) to [Save the Icerunner](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34681) with [Thieves' Guild Night On the Town](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42069) or [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26788), many quests have been changed.

You should know that the [Thieves Guild have Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33256) now, and you can [Renounce the Daedra if you will](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36100), while [Vampires can skip Fort Dawnguard](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25783). A much more detailled Spreadsheet on the changes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15h4lGfMr4z_1hqPp8LDVbTLLRqgjaQBUUSIYc6XtJGU/edit#gid=0).

## Followers
[Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194) will provide a nice amount of high quality followers but there is still the unforgettable [Inigo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461), [Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035), [Auri](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11278) ([with her cute face overhaul!](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29345)), [Vilja](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6722), and even [Hoth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16137). There is also Serana [Dialogue Edit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16222) and [Add-on](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32161) for all those who love the goth cutie.

## Loot, Artefacts and Leveling 
[Reliquary of Myth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31612) overhauls all vanilla Artifacts and [Dynamic Dungeon Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10308) coupled with [Lock Related Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11342) makes sure you do not find spider webs in the dungeon chests. [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) changes levelling so that exploring the world of Skyrim increase your level with skill levels increasing independently. There is a skill cap to avoid powerlevelling which is determined by the player character level. More details on this can be seen on the [modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751), which I recommend you read.

## Enemies and General Difficulty 
QWEST! isn't here to make the game feel like it's Dark Souls' difficulty. My philosophy on enemies is that diversity should be more important than difficulty, and that very diversity is gonna make the game more challenging. That is why you will find all kinds of bandits, draugrs, vampires, dragons, while they all have new cool spells due to [EEOS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37228) and their spawns are increased due to [Genesis Unleashed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23871).

A wide variety of mods are used to increase variety to the enemies you ecounter across the worldspaces. Draugrs have been improved using [DUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21775), [BriDO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26188) and [Cannibal Draugr on Solstheim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21238). Bandits have been improved using [OBIS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4145) and it's Patrol addon. Vampires have been improved through the use of [Better Vampire NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9510). Dragons are improved using [Splendor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9670), [Diverse Dragons Collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/695) and [Zim's Dragon Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38693). This list is not exhaustive!

## Installation
### Pre-Installation

These steps are only needed if you install this Modlist for the first time. If you are updating the Modlist, jump straight to [Updating](#updating).

#### Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

I doubt you need to do this since you likely already have this installed. This package is required for MO2 and you can download it from [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads). Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". [Direct link](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) if you can't find it.

#### Steam Library

If you have your steam library in program files, read [this](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide) to put it somewhere else.
I will not provide support to people with Skyrim in their Program Files folder.

#### Change Steams Update Behavior

SSE is still being updated by Bethesda (they only add Creation Club content). Whenever the game updates, the entire modding community goes silent for the next one or two weeks because some mods need to be updated to the latest game runtime version.

To ensure that Steam does not automatically updates the game for you, head over to the Properties window, navigate to the _Updates_ tab and change _Automatic updates_ to _Only update this game when I launch it_. You should also disable the Steam Cloud while you're at it.

#### Set the Game language to English

Just do it. This entire Modlist is in English and 99% of all mods you will find are also in English. I highly recommend playing the game in English and **I will not give support to people with a non-English game**.

Open the Steam Properties window, navigate to the _Language_ tab and select _English_ from the dropdown menu.

#### Clean Skyrim

I highly recommend uninstalling the game through Steam, deleting the game folder and reinstalling it. You should also clean up the `Skyrim Special Edition` folder in `Documents/My Games/` by deleting the contents in it. Alternatively, use the [Shredder](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30133).

If you ever used Vortex to mod Skyrim SE, using the Shredder becomes a critically important step, as Vortex will conflict heavily with any Wabbajack installation, so backup your stuff or shred it.

## Start Skyrim

After you have done everything above and got a clean SSE installation ready, start the Launcher and open the _Options_ menu.

1. Leave the quality to what Skyrim sets it to, but you can lower it if you wish. FPS gain is minor though.
2. Set the _Aspect Ratio_ and _Resolution_ to your monitor's native values
3. Set _Antialiasing_ to _Off_
4. Check _Windowed Mode_ and _Borderless_

Start the game and exit once you're in the main menu.

### Using Wabbajack

## Preparations

Download the release to a _working folder_. This folder **must not** be in a _common folders_ like your Desktop, Downloads or Program Files folder. It's best to create a Wabbajack folder near the root level of your drive like `C:/Wabbajack`.

Grab the latest release of Wabbajack from [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and place the `Wabbajack.exe` file in the _working folder_.

Wabbajack will not work with Windows 7, I will not offer any kind of support for users of that operating system.

## Downloading and Installing

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. Wabbajack will calculate the amount of threads it will use at the start of the installation. To have the highest amount of threads and thus the fastest speed, it is advised to have the working folder on an SSD.

1. Open Wabbajack
2. Browse the Gallery and Select QWEST!
3. Create a folder for the List at the root of your drive (like the Wabbajack folder) called "QWEST!".
4. Select the created folder in 3. as your installation folder.
5. Go back to your drive, and create a new folder, called "Wabbajack Downloads Folder". This specific folder can be on a different drive if you wish.
6. Select the created folder in 5. as your downloads folder.
7. Click the Go/Begin button.
8. Wait for Wabbajack to finish.

### Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where Wabbajack will produce an error. I recommend re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off so you loose no progress.

**Could not download x**:

If a mod updated and the old files got deleted, it is impossible to download them. In this case just wait till I update the Modlist.

**x is not a whitelisted download**:

This can happen when I update the modlist. Check if a new update is available and wait if there is none.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder**:

Wabbajack will not work with a pirated version of the game. If you own the game on Steam, go back to the [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation) step.

### Post-Installation

## Copy Game Folder Files

Copy the all of the files from the `QWEST!/Game Folder Files` directory into your game folder.

## Graphical Settings

On a Ryzen 5 2400G paired with a GTX 950 2GB VRAM and 24GB RAM (never used more than 14GB, so 8GB RAM should be fine, **WHEN** installed on an SSD, if you use an HDD 16GB RAM minimum is recommended):
BethINI is located within `QWEST!/Tools`.
Make sure that Bethini is configured to the profile folder you will use in MO2 and not your vanilla INIs or any change will be rendered worthless!
Here are the normal INI Path that you should have in the Setup tab: [EnaiRim](https://prnt.sc/10ha499) [SimonRim](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/793809552353132566/818888086079012915/Capture.PNG). If one or the other doesn't show properly, use the browse option to manually set it up.

- BethINI(Low)(locked to 60 FPS):
  - Everywhere(where it got tested): 60FPS

- BethINI(Medium)(locked to 60 FPS): 
  - Outdoors: 30-40 FPS (average 40)
  - Cities: 40-60 FPS (average 50)
  - Indoors: 60FPS

- If you have 8GB RAM and **NO SSD** or if it still has frame drops, then I recommend:
  - Testing:
    - BethINI(Medium) -> BethINI(Poor) and stopping by the preset that has a playable framerate for you.

## Getting an ENB

This list is aimed towards very low end PCs, but that doesn't mean ENB isn't an option.

For anyoner who has a 2GB vram card, I advise you to skip this step and test in game first. Once you have tested, come back and read the following. 

ENB is the biggest performance hit in modding (provided you don't go crazy on textures and have lot of high poly stuff everywhere which I didn't), and for the lucky ones with more than 2GB of vram but still not a lot, a custom tweaked version of [Zangdar's Rudy Cathedral](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39113) that was specifically made for this list is included. To install Zangdar's Rudy Cathedral, navigate to `Your Installation Folder\ENB Presets`([here](http://prntscr.com/10e2nl4)) and simply drag and drop the contents of either the performance one or the higher end one to your Skyrim SE Directory (where the game .exe is). [Those](http://prntscr.com/10e2odv).
On 2GB Cards, the average fps is 30 with the Low End Preset and Medium Bethini Preset. This is very dependent on your PC however so your mileage may vary.

There is also another option which is ReShade. ReShade is simpler than ENBs as they generally focus on color correction but if rightly used, they can enhance the game graphics nicely with even lower fps loss. Couple that with a SKyrim set on Low and even the weaker gpus can experience more than vanilla Skyrim lighting.

For Skyrim, it's very common for ReShade to be made with a certain ENB in mind, but some exist to be used on top of Vanilla Skyrim. I'll introduce you to 2 of them.
- [BTS - Beautifully Textured Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25489)
- [Ulver](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40433)

You can have both at the same time in your Skyrim, so if you want to try both you can download them and follow the installation instructions:

- Download the latest ReShade Version from [here](https://reshade.me/)
- Open ReShade.exe, Select SkyrimSE.exe as the game you want to install it to. 
- Select Direct3D 10/11/12 as the rendering API
- Check/Tick every single box until ReShade is installed.
Now we'll go back to the presets downloaded
- Open the ReShade Preset archive and paste it to your game folder.
- When Skyrim launches (Refer to the next step in the readme if lost on this step), press the home button on your keyboard and select the .ini file you just put in your Skyrim Folder as the loaded .ini
- Press home again to close the window.
Know that you can switch any ini at anytime during your gameplay, so if you want to compare between the 2 that I recommend, you can totally do that in game.

## Profiles 

QWEST! has 2 profiles, one with EnaiRim, one with SimonRim. The main difference is that EnaiRim is kinda unbalanced and very strong while SimonRim is kinda like what vanilla Skyrim should've been.
You can look them up here: [EnaiRim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191) and [SimonRim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746).

To change the profile, there's a dropdown menu on the top left of MO2. The default profile is EnaiRim, so only change if you want the SimonRim one.

## Personalisation

On top of the 2 Profiles available for the core gameplay mods, QWEST! comes with some Quality of Life changes and gameplay mods that some may or may not enjoy. All of the modifcations detailed below are supported as written. No support will be given if any other modifications happen or you deviate from what is detailed below.

First possible modifications is the [Survival Setup](http://prntscr.com/1152kn9). It is enabled by default as it has to be patched by Synthesis to work correctly. But if you follow carefully what I'm about to write, you will be able to remove it entirely. Yes entirely as I do not support removing only hypothermia or cleaning and washing while keeping food and sleep needs. There are 2 steps:
- Untick all the mods under ``Survival Stuff`` ( [those](http://prntscr.com/1152kn9) ) 
- Tick the ``Synthesis No Survival`` at the bottom of the left pannel corresponding to your profile.
Please note that there's a neat little mod on top of all of those that is disabled by default; called [Just Blood Lite](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46501), it enables blood to appear as you take damage on you and enemies, and goes away as you regenerate health! More detail on the modpage but if you want it, just enable it! It obviously doesn't work when Dirt and Blood is on so it's off by default. 

Second modification: [Paper Ui](http://prntscr.com/xb9im1). It is enabled by default but you can disable one or both of those depending on what you want.

Third modification: [Unequip Quiver](http://prntscr.com/xb9k5u). Disabled by default, it'll make your Player Character unequip it's ammunition everytime you go out of combat if turned on.

Fourth modification: [Oblivion Style HUD](http://prntscr.com/xb9lrc). Disabled by default, it'll make the UI have an oblivion style like [this](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/463/463-1511538957-694432832.png)

Fifth Modification is the difficulty tweak that allows NPCs to have Ordinator Perks; it'll make the experience much more challenging but I play with it myself. Here's the [modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42022).

Sixth Modification is [Quick Loot](http://prntscr.com/10eh3rd). Enabled by default, it adds a little box showing the inventory of whatever container, corpse, or anything that you're hovering, so you know what's inside without opening it. If you do not want that, simply untick the mod. (It's under the "Quality of Life" Separator in MO2)

Seventh is [NeverNude](http://prntscr.com/1152dvf). The list is Nude by default, ticking those (and unticking Bijin Skin) should make it NeverNude, which is way better for Twitch or a skeptical wife!

Eight and last modification: [Gamepad Guide](http://prntscr.com/xb9op3). Disabled by default, ask for the Gamepad guide in [MY Discord](https://discord.gg/ZgjVrXp) (not Wabbajack's) if you want the details on how to use a controller with QWEST!

## How to start up QWEST!

Head over to the installation folder and locate an executable named `ModOrganizer.exe` and launch it. Once its launched there will be a dropdown box on the top right and a big run button next to it. Ensure it is set to SKSE by selecting it in the dropdown box and then hitting the run button.

## Updating

If this Modlist receives an update please check the Changelog before doing anything. Always backup your saves or start a new game after updating.

**Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!**

This means that any additional mods you have installed on top of the Modlist will be deleted. Your downloads folder will not be touched!

Updating is like installing. You only have to make sure that you select the same path and tick the _overwrite existing Modlist_ button.

## In-Game MCM Options
Once the game has loaded. Wait until there are no more messages on the top left corner. Then you can hit escape and click on Mod Configuration to continue this section.

MCMs are not automated due to a personal choice: There are many, many important tweaks, informations, and usefull stuff in them that can solve problems or make your experience better. Those are my own and what I recommend for the least amount of problems and a balanced experience.

#### Game Difficulty
- The difficulty in this Modlist is quite harder due to Genesis Spawns and enemy diversity brought by Draugr Upgrades and Improvements, OBIS or Better Vampire NPCs. I highly suggest playing in Adept or Expert and putting it higher only if you feel it's too easy.

    - SunHelm Suvival : Enabled (close MCMs and wait a bit in game)
- It is a fully customizable mod so if something bothers you in game, you can go back to this MCM and tweak it.
    
#### Tentapalooza (Survival)
- Set all tents in all tabs as "Rain and Snow" instead of "No Protection"
    
#### The Ultimate Dodge Mod  
 - Here is where you configure which key will allow you to Sneak (or crouch) and which will allow you to Dodge. TUDM hijacks the vanilla sneak key to have no delay or script lag.
   - A Keybinding example would be:
      - Vanilla Sneak key within Options: C
      - Sneak key within TUDM's MCM: Left Control
  - Now your character will roll/sidestep with C and Sneak with Left Control
  - I also would recommend to use sidestep (personal preference)
  - Please Note: 
    - You cannot dodge in the Starting Cell, you need to choose a path first.
    - The first time you'll dodge, you'll be stuck in a weird position in the air, Press G (or your dodge swap key) 2 times to be un stuck.


- Npc Settings :

## FAQ

## Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the MO2 folder and be done with it. SKSE and ENB files will still be in your game folder so I recommend using [ENB and ReShade Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4143) if you want to remove the ENB.

## Ultrawide Options

Although I do not see why someone would have such a screen with the targetted minimals of the list, here's a document made by Mantis to help you solve such problems. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D3Yapmu_IkTWSszJ4h9wpNxgNLCi46f7XiJknpdMb6E/edit?usp=sharing)

## I have a question

Ask it in my Discord, link [here](https://discord.gg/ZgjVrXp). The support channel in the Wabbajack Discord is for Installation questions, not support over in game stuff or suggestions.

## I have a bug

Report it in my Discord, link [here](https://discord.gg/ZgjVrXp). The support channel in the Wabbajack Discord is for Installation questions, not bug reports.

## Serana Re-Imagined is ticked off in the right panel.

Known and on purpose, don't bother me with that please.

## A face part is crashing me!

The 5th Facepart is a lie. Known and unsolvable.

## I can't talk to NPCs!

Headwear that conceals your identity will stop NPCs from interacting with you, for more details check [Sneak Tools' Modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1863)

## First Person animations are weird, how do I fix??

1st person animations are overhauled by [First Person Combat Animations Overhaul 2.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45177). If it bothers you, you can safely disable it in MO2.

## I want to support your work!

I thank you for that thought but you should probably donate to Wabbajack first. Link [here](https://www.patreon.com/user/overview?u=11907933). If you still want to only support me, my patreon is [here](https://www.patreon.com/Sovn).

The same goes for _Enhancements_ or _Feature/Mod Requests_. **DO NOT DM ME ON DISCORD.
